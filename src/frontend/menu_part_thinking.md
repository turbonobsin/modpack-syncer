## Tabbed Sections
- expose div for tab list that you can supply ops for and add parts to
- expose div for main area

## Mods Thinking
- make folders that get stored in the instances meta folder or in it's meta file maybe
- when selecting multiple and right clicking and marking a set of mods as "Local Only", it will move them to a folder called "local" which is a folder that is auto generated and marked to be local and independent of the mod syncing
- you can create folders for testing and disabling mods or grouping them or if you want to disable a whole folder of mods at once
    - do I want to support nested folders?
    - probably don't need to at the moment but not sure
